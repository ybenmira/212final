# Introduction
Research Question: Does anti-Muslim sentiment manifest itself equally among the four major racial groups in the USA: Asian, White, Black, and Hispanic, depending on levels of American Identification?

The goal of this research project is to determine how race and American identity impacts policy preferences towards Muslims. This study pulls from an established article by Nazita Lajevardi and Kassra A.R. Oskooii, "Anti-Muslim policy preferences and boundaries of American identity across partisanship" (2024). This study regressed American identity with policy preferences. I am building off of this research and establishing how race impacts results. American identity can mean different things to different people and taking race into consideration can help us understand if this American identity is inherently xenophobic towards Muslims. By gauging specific policy points, we can get a wide scope information on how American identity and race impacts views of Muslims in different policy fields.

I intend to regress attitudes on these policy preferences which include: Banning Muslims from entering the USA, patrolling Muslim neighborhoods and communities, banning sharia law, and restricting the construction of Mosques. I want to regress attitudes about these policy preferences by race and American Identity. I will control for race in different LM models to see how White Americans, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans differ in their policy preferences towards Muslims depending on their American identity. This is important to study, because as will become clear in the theory section, low ranking racial groups do not employ as many borders to the notion of being American. Further, any racial group that does come close to the high ranking racial group (Whites) in their policy preferences towards Muslims should be further studied as a means to understand how they can either penetrate the high ranking racial group and why is anti-outsider sentiments inherent in their notion of American identity even if they do not come from this high ranking group.

Overall, I find that American identity for white people is a strong predictor of anti-Muslim policy preferences. For other racial groups, there is also a correlation between the two, albeit, when taking into account the R2 value it isn't wholly predictive. Hispanics come closest to white people in this behavior, albiet, still with a considerable predictive gap. Three important implications stem from these results. 

# Theoretical Framework 
The theoretical approach for this question stems from Niambi Carter and Efren Perez's article, "Race and Nation: How Racial Hierarchy Shapes National Attachments" (2016). They largely argue that domestic racial hierarchies influence how Americans view their national identities, specifically how does relative positioning of one's race domestically impact their views on outsiders. High ranking status groups (Whites) will attempt to reinforce their own status by restricting entrance into their identity to maintain distinctiveness. Low ranking status groups will attempt to exhibit social creativity in line with Tafjel and Turner's Social Identity Theory. Because of their low ranking status, they attempt to create broader borders as they are unable to penetrate high ranking groups (as race is an impenetrable categorization); they will instead attempt to refashion the American identity to make it a civic and inclusive identity, not a racial one.

![DAG Model without Controls](images/dagitty-model.png)

H1: Attitudes towards foreigners for low ranking groups (non-Whites) will be more inclusive and American identity will not be as anti-Muslim as whites who identity strongly with the American identity. H2: While American identity will correlate with anti-Muslim sentiment, the relationship will be stronger for whites than for other racial groups. H3: The positive effect of American identity on support for restricting mosques is stronger among individuals who identify as more conservative compared to those who identify as more liberal.

# Research Design

The first step will filter out responses based on race. I want to just look at only hispanics, only whites, only blacks, and only asians for each set of regression models. After creating 4 datasets that only include each of the four races, I will measure the regression of American identity on the 4 anti-Muslim policy preferences. These regression models will tell us whether American identity is correlated with anti-Muslim policy preferences across all races. I will then compare and contrast the coefficient of each of these 4 racial groups. We expect to see higher coefficients for whites. Further, I will then compare relative R2 values for each of the policy preferences to gauge how predictive American identity is on anti-Muslim policy preferences. I expect that American identity will correlate with more anti-Muslim policy preferences, but the relationship (R2) will be much weaker for non-Whites. I control for ideology, republican, and democract. Since my goal is to plainly look at American identity on these policy preferences, controlling for ideology and party affiliation will isolate this specific relationship. We do not want to capture political ideology nor political affiliation and this relationship with recent Republican comments regarding Muslims and instead are just looking at American identity.

## Sample

I pulled this dataset from a study from Nazita Lajevardi and Kassra A.R. Oskooii, "Anti-Muslim policy preferences and boundaries of American identity across partisanship" (2024). This study collected data in 2018 from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). The CCES is a large-scale survey that is administered to a representative sample of the American population. They further collected their own opt-in survey data from 2019 and 2020. I intend to only use the 2019 and 2020 sample as they largely ask the same questions and have the same identifiers. This brings our total sample to 5,612 responses. The 2018 data sample has 721. Adding the 2018 data could've enhanced our sample with more respondents, but I decided to only use the 2019 and 2020 data to keep the data consistent. I used the comprehensive AMID variable to gauge American identity rather than parsing out the 5 AMID variables because it captures the total feelings and overall American identity. I used 4 anti-Muslim policies. I did not use the weapon ban as these were collected in light of the Orlando night club shooting thus potentially heightening the emotional responses.

## Measurement

Like mentioned before, I am trying to understand Social Creativity vis a vis Social Identity Theory. This specific phenomenon insists that high ranking status groups will attempt to maintain distinctiveness while low ranking will use social creativity by being less hostile to outsiders. By using a linear regression, we can visualize how our independent variable, American identity, impacts our dependent variables, support for Anti-Muslim policies. AMID is measured from 0 to 1 based on 5 questions asked that gauge American identity. As the histogram below demonstrates, we have a large samply of high identifying Americans. There is nothing we should change here as it helps us with a good amount of data points with high identifying Americans, especially those of non-White background. I further created histograms for each of the policy preferences. The data looks good as we have a good number of people who have varying levels of support. There is not transformation needed.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#histogram of American Identity#
AMID_hist = dta |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Amid)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of American Identity", 
       x = "American Identity", y = "Frequency")

#histogram of anti-Muslim policy preferences#
M_Hist = dta |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = banmuslims)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Banning Muslims", x = "Banning Muslims")
  
P_Hist = dta |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = patrol)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Patrolling Muslims", x = "Patrolling Muslims")

S_Hist = dta |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sharia)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Banning Sharia Law", x = "Banning Sharia Law")

R_Hist = dta |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = restrictmosques)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Restricting Mosques", x = "Restricting Mosques")

DV_hists = M_Hist + P_Hist + S_Hist + R_Hist
```

## Controls

I am controlling for political ideology, democrat, and republican. I am attempting to just look at American identity, regardless of political affiliation. Normally, we would expect American identity to be correlated with political ideology and affiliation but this is not always the case. For example, liberal democrats can identify as highly American and by controlling this phenomenon, we can isolate the relationship between American identity and anti-Muslim policy preferences. Furthermore, we do not want to capture political affiliation for people who could potentially just accept the party line and comments from republican or democratic leaders.

## Specification

$$
Y_{\text{anti-muslim}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Amid} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{ideology} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{democrat} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{republican} + \epsilon
$$

# Results

The first model will look at the impact on each of the four anti-Muslim policy preferences vis a vis American identity, with ideology and party affiliation controlled. Each of the four sets of models for each race will only run regressions on the datasets filtered out by race. The stargazers below show the coefficients, R2 value, and whether each coefficient is significant.

I have also created scatter plots with line of best fit for each of the models. I have grouped banning muslims and patrolling communities together and banning sharia law and restricting mosques together. All four observed races are found in each grouping for comparison. I split up policies two and two because all 16 graphs on one sheet was far too cluttered. 8 on each is much better. The plots show that for white people, as American identity goes up, they are more likely to support anti-Muslim policies. The other racial categories shows some correlation. To better compare the groups, I further created lollipop graphs that compare coefficients and R2 values. Obviously, by including coefficients we can determine whether there is a correlation between American identity.

White people top the charts, surprisingly hispanics follow closely behind for banning Muslims and restricting the construction of mosques. This is interesting because they are not inherently a high ranking group in the US. However, by also comparing R2 values, we can determine if this relationship is as predictive as the coefficients lead us to believe. Here the picture fits better with our hypotheses (even though we did admit that some non-white groups may mirror white high identifying Americans, just that it wouldn't be wholly predictive) in that white people still top the charts. There is a strong correlation between American identity and anti-Muslim policy preferences. Everyone else is far behind. For hispanics there may be extremely influential data points bringing the coefficient up as the R2 value indicates that even for hispanics, American identity is not as predictive as it is for whites.

I will further gauge these models by controlling for democrat and republican, but this time, I will use ideology as an interaction term. By doing this, we can look at both if conservative or liberal and highly identifying Americans will express more anti-Muslim policy preferences. This will also tell us if ideology is a moderating factor in the relationship between American identity and anti-Muslim policy preferences. And finally, if ideology is correlated with American identity.

When we include ideology as an interaction term, we are trying to see if the relationship between American identity and anti-Muslim policy preferences is stronger when ideology is fixed at 0. Across all racial categories and anti-Muslim policy preferences, when ideology is included, the coefficient or slope increases (except for banning sharia for hispanics which goes from 0.19 to 0.151). For liberals (ideology score of 0), American Identity increases actually has a much more pronounced effect on support for anti-Muslim policies. By using this interaction term we can isolate American identity. When taking into account the interaction values which indicates that the AMID coefficient for conservatives are lower which means that AMID has a less pronounced effect on support for anti-Muslim policy preferences, however this is mostly because the starting point of support for these policies is already high. Interestingly, for liberals, who we would normally assume always dislike discriminatory policies, American identity increases for them actually heighten support for anti-Muslim policy preferences. For example: in this model, when AMID is 0 and ideology is 0, Ban Muslim support is 0.003 and when AMID is 0 and ideology is 1, the support is .503. When we make AMID 1 for both of these examples, the "liberal" is up to 0.462 and the "conservative" goes up to 0.535. This indicates that across the board, support for anti-Muslim policy preferences isn't inherently ideological, it is intertwined with feelings of American identity.

Even though there are coefficient increases with the interaction term for the other races, the R2 values are still all very weak, and much weaker than white liberals in this case. This proves the central claim of this research project that for white people, the American identity is associated with animosity towards outsiders, even for liberals. Other races demonstrate increased support for anti-Muslim policies, but the relationship is not as predictive as it is for white people. However, for this research, we are attempting to purely identify the relationship between AMID and anti-Muslim policy preferences. We are not trying to capture the relationship between ideology and anti-Muslim policy preferences. This is why we are not looking at the interaction term for ideology and anti-Muslim policy preferences, instead the first model is best suited.

# Regression Diagnostics

As noted in the previous section, Hispanics have some influential data points that are driving up the coefficients as evidenced by the weak R2 value. I want to run regression diagnostics on the Ban Muslims for Hispanics regression models to determine if there are influential data points.

```{r, include = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.show = "hold"}
library(car)
#multicollinarity test#
vif_h_b = vif(lmh_b)

#influence plot#
inf_h_b = influenceIndexPlot(lmh_b)
dta_hispanic1 = dta_hispanic[-101,] [-201,] [-203,] [-232,] [-363,]

lmh_b1 = lm(banmuslims ~ Amid+ ideology_7pt+ 
              democrat + republican, dta_hispanic1)

#new stargazer comparing new hispanic for banning muslims#
ban_muslims_star_influence = stargazer(lmw_b, lmh_b1, lmb_b, lma_b, 
                                       type = "text",
                                       omit.stat=c("f", "ser"),
          title = "Regression Results for Ban Muslims by 
          Race without Influential Hispanic points",
          column.labels = c("White", "Hispanic", "Black", "Asian"))

```

I first ran variance inflation factor to test for multicollinarity. Since no value is above 5, it seems that each of these 4 there is a lack of highly correlated variables. I further ran an Influence Index Plot test to gauge influential points. Without the influential points, the coefficient for hispanics for ban muslims drops from 0.266 to 0.258. Further, the R2 values get slightly more predictive as it moves from 0.080 to 0.084. By removing 5 influential points the coefficient drops by 0.008 and the R2 value becomes increases by 0.004. This is a good sign that the model is more predictive and less influenced by outliers in this second model.

# Next Steps

The point of this research project was to gauge the relationship between American identity and anti-Muslim policy preferences. We found that for white people, American identity is correlated with anti-Muslim policy preferences. We further found that this relationship is not as predictive for non-White groups. The original paper that this theory is based on gauged just White and Black people. It largely found the same results as this project when we just look at White and Black. While American identity was correlated with anti-Muslim policy preferences for black people, it was not very predictive. The Hispanic group stuck out to me, while its R2 value was weak, the coefficient for some policies was on par with the white group. The permeability of race for certain white passing hispanics may indicate that when one can join a high status group, they will start to mirror the behavior of the high status group. This is not possible for many black and asians who are phenotypically more distinct from the high status group, they must instead employ social creativity about defining the American identity.

Further research could look at the the evolving status of the Hispanic community in the US. As the Hispanic community further assimilates into the United States, more and more people may start to penetrate the high status group thus mirroring the behavior one would expect in line with Social Identity Theory. We could conduct another study comparing responses from White people regarding other anti-outsider policies with Hispanics. Using the white group as a baseline, we could see how time spent in the US, whether they are multi-generational, how much they associate with their ancestral home, and finally American identification impacts their preferences towards anti-outsider policies. More "assimilated" hispanics may continue to mirror white people and their anti-outsider sentiments as long as they profess the same level of American identification.
